The way this calculation works, you will see a result lower than what you will actually make. Currently trying to figure out the calculations for federal taxes, but i find it better to get more than calculated rather than more! Any help would be absolutely appreciated. if you plan to use this, I highly reccomend using your state and local tax rate by simply searching it and changing it. Thanks for your cooperation!
